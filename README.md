+ A Java based application developed using hash table. 
+ I have developed this application as a part of my college final year assignment.

## Hash Table

### Introduction and Background Research
The key or value pairs are stored in a hash table. It specifies the key object as well as the value that goes with it. After that, the key is hashed, and the hash code is used as an index in the table where the value is kept. A hash table is a key value lookup, so it allows you to associate a value with a given key for a quick lookup. If you need to associate a name with a set of information about it, a hash table is the ideal solution because you can put this into the hash table. The following are the most important Java Hash table class concepts to understand:
+ It is like HashMap, but it is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not.
+	It will not accept a null key or a null value.
+	Duplicate keys are not accepted.
+	It keeps key-value pairs in a hash table data structure, which internally keeps a list array. Each list can be thought of as a bucket. Pairs are stored in this list if they collide.
+	Hash tableâ€™s enumerator is not fail-safe.

### Description of the patterns
Design Pattern is a software template that is used to solve a problem that arises frequently while designing a Software Application or a Software Framework. It includes set of rules that describe how to complete specific tasks in the field of software development.

+ Iterator pattern : The Iterator Pattern is used to access an aggregate in a sequential manner without exposing its underlying representation. One of the behavioural patterns used to give a consistent way to travel through a group of Objects is the iterator pattern. The Iterator pattern is common in the Java Collection Framework, where the Iterator interface provides methods for traversing a collection.

+ Visitor Pattern : It is used to perform an action on an element structure without changing how the elements are implemented.
A taxi company's operation can be cited as an example of the visitor pattern. The company accepts a guest when a person phones a taxi company, and a cab is despatched. When a visitor or customer boards a taxi, he relinquishes control over his location. The cabbie is now in charge. In terms of object-oriented coding, the driver class has control over the customer class. In addition to the visitor, the driver class can introduce new operations.
We can use the patterns in two different contexts rather than as substitutes for one another. In the Visitor Pattern, you implement an Interface Acceptor for each element you want to visit. As a result, the Visitor Pattern relies on Interfaces rather than a superclass.

### Conclusion
My findings about patterns are as follows:
+	Patterns can be reused in different projects.
+	Patterns are used to provide solutions that make it easier to define system architecture.
+	Patterns are used to make the code more flexible. Thus, it can be maintained
+	Patterns make the design of an application visible.

Design patterns are used to provide solutions that make it easier to define system architecture. They make an application's design more transparent. Expert developers' Design Patterns illustrate that these are tried-and-true solutions, and they help to clarify the System Architecture and the possibility of creating a better system.
